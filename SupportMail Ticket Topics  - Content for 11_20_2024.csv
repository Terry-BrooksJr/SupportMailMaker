Issue,✅,23/09/2024, Allain Dollete,Cengage,https://learnositysupport.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/26185,Content Dupliction/Author API,"Cengage requested guidance on duplicating their content to ensure instructors cannot modify original Cengage content. The requirements include shallow copies for activities, deep copies for items, and customized tagging. Due to limitations in the Author API for tagging duplicated content, they proposed using undocumented endpoints to meet these requirements temporarily. Learnosity reviewed and allowed this as an interim solution with conditions: the approach would remain unsupported, subject to changes without notice, and should not influence the priority of new feature requests. Cengage agreed, adding unit tests to mitigate risks. Later, Cengage encountered a replication lag issue when retrieving duplicated items, and Learnosity cautioned against relying on this method long-term due to the inherent risks and unpredictability of undocumented APIs.",
Issue,❌,23/08/2024,Michael Fares,Hodder & Stoughton Limited,,Accessibility,"The HMH reported that italicized text in Learnosity assessments was not being recognized by the NVDA screen-reader on Windows, causing the screen reader to skip or stop reading the text entirely. Assigned ASE  requested example items, screen-reader details, and a screen recording to investigate the issue. Through testing, it was determined that the problem arose from using mouse navigation with NVDA’s mouse tracking mode enabled, which interrupted the continuous reading when the cursor moved away from the passage. Learnosity advised the client to utilize keyboard commands for navigating content, as this approach is better supported by NVDA for uninterrupted screen reading. The client acknowledged the guidance, recognized the need to improve their understanding of accessibility tools, and subsequently closed the ticket after implementing the recommended practices.",
